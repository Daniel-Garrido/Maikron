        <span>Combating Forest Fires with Advanced Technology: Innovation in Early Detection through Artificial Intelligence</span>
      </h2>
      <p class="projects__description section__description">
        At Maikron, in collaboration with CentroGeo, a significant project is underway with the goal of transforming the way forest fires are detected in Mexico. Utilizing advanced artificial intelligence technologies, specifically convolutional neural networks, the project aims to develop a robust model to identify forest fires in their early stages through satellite imagery. This approach not only promises to improve the effectiveness in combating deforestation but also surpasses the traditional methods currently in use.
Randy Alexandro Santos Poot, an undergraduate student at the Technological Institute of Mérida, is motivated by both the desire to help the community and the opportunity to deepen his knowledge in artificial intelligence and machine learning as part of his social service project. "Being able to help the community by developing a project and also learn a lot and develop my skills during it," Randy mentions regarding his motivations.
Throughout the project, Randy has significantly improved his understanding of artificial intelligence, and although he has not faced major challenges so far, he anticipates that dealing with satellite imagery will be his biggest test, given that many of the required concepts are new to him.
The main objective has evolved from predicting fires to detecting them in their early phases, which is seen as more feasible and useful for the authorities fighting these natural disasters. "Being able to detect forest fires in their early stages so that the authorities can respond to these natural disasters," explains Randy, emphasizing the critical need to improve the available tools.
Looking to the future, Randy sees this project not only as a contribution to his field of study but also as a practical tool to combat a growing environmental problem. His advice for others interested in working on socially impactful projects is clear: "Do it for the good of our community and interact with each other to share ideas and knowledge."
Besides his commitment to this innovative project, Randy enjoys competitive video games, which provide a necessary balance between his academic and personal life.
This project highlights the potential of artificial intelligence to address complex environmental problems and demonstrates how technology can be a powerful force for social and environmental good.
