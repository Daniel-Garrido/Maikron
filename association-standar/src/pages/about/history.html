        In the context of Mexico, as in many other parts of the world, artificial intelligence (AI) has often been shrouded in mystery and speculation. From science fiction stories to debates about the future of work, AI has been a subject of both fascination and concern in equal measure. However, amid these myths and distorted perceptions, Mexico stands at a unique crossroads: it has the potential to leverage the benefits of AI to drive economic and social progress, while also facing particular challenges in terms of access, training, and regulation.
        In this scenario, where technological advancements and artificial intelligence are often viewed with skepticism and fear, the MAIKRON Association was born, founded by a group of visionaries and enthusiasts of technology and science. The reason for the associationâ€™s creation lies in demonstrating that AI and technology can be positive forces that contribute to the well-being of society.
